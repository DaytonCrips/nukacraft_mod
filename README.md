# nukacraft_mod
This is my first mod, created with the support of friends. It is based on the Fallout game universe and positions itself as a sandbox mod with no apparent goal or progression.

A little tour of the content:
-A custom dimension and a unique way to move into it
-Some themed HUGE biomes in the wastelands
-New type of culture - Underwater (But first, find these crops and start your unique farming business...)
-Weapons with the possibility of pumping 
-Pip Boy is your guide in traveling through the wasteland
-Power Armor will provide you with a solid defense...
-And new mobs will provide you with a steady worry of safety...
-Vault Tec shelters hold secrets, but the military structures are far more dangerous and mysterious
-Energy based on radioactive residue
-This list we'll be adding to...


Only develops on 1.18.2 and also requires GeckoLib*, ChasisCore by Jetug and Framework by MrCrayfish*
